Humans tried to develop intelligent machines as secondary reflex systems,
turning over primary decisions to mechanical servants. Gradually, though, the
creators did not leave enough to do for themselves; they began to feel
alienated, dehumanized, and even manipulated. Eventually humans became little
more than decisionless robots themselves, left without an understanding of their
natural existence.

In surviving, shall our humanity endure? That which makes life sweet for the
living -- warm and filled with beauty -- this, too, must be. But we shall not

denying thought, we cannot reflect upon what we touch. And if we dare deny the
flesh, we unwheel the vehicle that carries us all.

One of the greatest problems in our universe is how to control procreation, and

Aristotle raped reason. He implanted in the dominant schools of philosophy the
attractive belief that there can be discrete separation between mind and body.

be understood without death.
